# PXS-score

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are frequently acquired in patients with COVID-19. While the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs for COVID-19 is poor, CXRs can help evaluate the severity of lung disease and its change over time, but there is substantial inter-rater variability. We develop a convolutional Siamese neural network-based algorithm can calculate a continuous radiographic pulmonary disease severity score in patients with COVID-19 (Pulmonary X-ray Severity (PXS) score), which can potentially be used for longitudinal evaluation and clinical risk stratification.

Training the convolutional siamese neural network is performed in two steps: (1) pre-training on CheXpert CXRs using weak labels using contrastive loss and (2) training on CXRs from patients with COVID-19 with disease severity labels using mean square error loss.

This work is published as "Automated Assessment and Tracking of COVID-19 Pulmonary Disease Severity on Chest Radiographs using Convolutional Siamese Neural Networks" in Radiology: Artificial Intelligence (Li et al. 2020, https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.2020200079). It builds on work published in npj Digital Medicine entitled "Siamese neural networks for continuous disease severity evaluation and change detection in medical imaging" (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0255-1).

Please refer to the manuscript methodology for details. 

**Requirements**: 

- Python 3.6.9
- PyTorch 1.5.0
- CUDA 10.2
- GPU support

**How to Run**:

The working directory should contain the following Python scripts:

- PXS_classes.py (Python helper classes)

(1) - for pre-training on CheXpert data
- PXS_label_processor.py (for processing CheXpert labels for input into PXS_train.py)
- PXS_train.py (script for pre-training with CheXpert)

(2) - for training on COVID-19 data
- PXS_preprocessing.py (DICOM pre-processing for inputs, same as applied in the CheXpert database)
- PXS_train_tuning.py (script for training with CXRs from patients with COVID-19)

(3) - for testing on COVID-19 data
- PXS_test.py (script for testing performance)

Run the scripts in an interactive shell, like IPython.
