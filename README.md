# PXS-score

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are frequently acquired in patients with COVID-19. While the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs for COVID-19 is poor, CXRs can help evaluate the severity of lung disease and its change over time, but there is substantial inter-rater variability. We develop a convolutional Siamese neural network-based algorithm can calculate a continuous radiographic pulmonary disease severity score in patients with COVID-19 (Pulmonary X-ray Severity (PXS) score), which can potentially be used for longitudinal evaluation and clinical risk stratification.

Training the convolutional siamese neural network is performed in two steps: (1) pre-training on CheXpert CXRs using weak labels using contrastive loss and (2) training on CXRs from patients with COVID-19 with disease severity labels using mean square error loss.

This work is released as a preprint on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20108159v1 and has been accepted for publication in Radiology Artificial Intelligence (in press). It builds on work published in npj Digital Medicine entitled "Siamese neural networks for continuous disease severity evaluation and change detection in medical imaging" (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0255-1).

Please refer to the manuscript methodology for details. 

**Requirements**: 

- Python 3.6.9
- PyTorch 1.5.0
- CUDA 10.2
- GPU support

**How to Run**:

The working directory should contain the following Python scripts:

- PXS_classes.py (Python helper classes)

(1) - for pre-training on CheXpert data
- PXS_label_processor.py (for processing CheXpert labels for input into PXS_train.py)
- PXS_train.py (script for pre-training with CheXpert)

(2) - for training on COVID-19 data
- PXS_preprocessing.py (DICOM pre-processing for inputs, same as applied in the CheXpert database)
- PXS_train_tuning.py (script for training with CXRs from patients with COVID-19)

(3) - for testing on COVID-19 data
- PXS_test.py (script for testing performance)

Run the scripts in an interactive shell, like IPython.
